# HomeMatic

This repository contains my personal collection of scripts for the HomeMatic Gateway CCU2.
HomeMatic script is a script language that provides access to the logic layer of the HomeMatic Gateway. Using HomeMatic script you are able to read and manipulate condition and status of HomeMatic devices. Furthermore you get access to system variables,  rooms, groups, favourites and programs.
