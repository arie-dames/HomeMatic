! HomeMatic Script Snippet:
! How to execute another program from within a program

! Please notice that ProgramExecute is undocumented and may be changed/removed without further notice.

! It's not possible to pass parameters to the program to use it like a subroutine, 
! in this case you may use system variables (welcome to HM script :-o)

dom.GetObject("NAME_OF_YOUR_PROGRAM").ProgramExecute();
